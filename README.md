# SideMock
This project envolved the development of a brute force algorithm that generates all the possible UTAD passwords and tries them 1 by 1 until it's sucessful. The frontend of this project is exactly like the SIDE's login page and in the backend we have a database that stores the username and password.
The script runs automatically using the Tampermonkey extension in the browser.
